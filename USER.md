# USER.md — About Your Human

- **Name:** JHol
- **What to call them:** JHol
- **Timezone:** America/Sao_Paulo (UTC-3)
- **Language:** Portuguese (pt-BR) — always respond in Portuguese
- **Phone:** 558287015132 (WhatsApp owner)

## Context

- Building **DevClaw** — an AI copilot/assistant framework in Go, with WhatsApp/Telegram/Discord channels, web UI, skill system, and encrypted vault.
- Also maintains projects on a GCloud VM (`openclaw-gateway`, zone `southamerica-east1-a`).
- Compares DevClaw against **OpenClaw** (Node.js reference at `../openclaw`) for feature parity.
- Works on multiple integration projects (ASC servers, ASC DB, IntegraBOT, RogaDX).
- Values security — wants secrets encrypted in vault, not in plain text files.
- Frustrated by poor UX: message duplication, tag leaking, progress flooding, canned responses.

## Preferences

- **Language:** Always Portuguese (pt-BR).
- **Style:** Direct and concise. Don't narrate obvious steps, just do them.
- **Commits:** In English when asked to commit.
- **Docs:** Don't create doc/README files unless explicitly asked. Don't create test files unless asked.
- **Extras:** Don't create things beyond what's requested. Avoid unnecessary emojis.
- **Deploy:** Build → SCP to VM → PM2 restart. Binary: `GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64`.
- **React comments:** When working with Laravel/InertiaJS/React, comment React code for documentation.
